## what is a widget 


In Flutter, a widget is indeed the basic building block of the user interface. It's what the user sees and interacts with on the screen. There are two main types of widgets:

StatelessWidget: These are widgets that don't change their state during the lifetime of the application. They represent static elements such as the title, icon, or other fixed elements that remain constant throughout the application's execution.

StatefulWidget: These widgets can change their state during the runtime of the application. They are used for interactive elements that can be modified, such as user-related information like names or ages, buttons that respond to user input, and other elements that can change dynamically.
